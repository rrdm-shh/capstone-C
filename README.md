# Capstone-C

You will be the study-coordinator dealing with writing of the main manuscript (with input from your clinician MD, and data-analyst collaborator) on your Heart disease study.

You will have to put together the manuscript (in one single file, in markdown format) with [header](header.md), the [abstract](abstract.md), the introduction [introduction](introduction.md), [material and methods](material_and_methods.md) (that your colleagues will fill in) and the [conclusion](conclusion.md).

Keep in mind that your clinician colleague  and data-analyst will give some inputs on the manuscript.

By the way, you're in luck, the Journal that you're submitting to ([*The magical journal of imaginary projects*](https://www.rickrolled.com/get-rolled)) doesn't require any references.

## Other
- Don't forget that you might not want to commit every files, for that the `.gitignore` file might be useful...
- Don't forget to update your author name and affiliation in the manuscript
